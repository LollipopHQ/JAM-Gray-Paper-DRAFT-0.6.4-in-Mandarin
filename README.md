# JAM Gray Paper DRAFT 0.6.4 release in Mandarin

The Lollipop team is pleased to present the Chinese translation of JAM Gray Paper.

With the JAM Chinese version, we aim to make this innovative approach for Web3 more accessible to the Chinese-speaking community, fostering broader engagement and development within the Polkadot ecosystem.

One of JAM’s core breakthroughs—PolkaVM’s compatibility with RISC-V chip architecture—coincidentally aligns with China’s strategic investments in RISC-V open-source hardware and its future development roadmap. While most Chinese internet companies’ consortium blockchains rely on open-source iterations of Ethereum’s network pioneered by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, the Chinese translation of JAM’s Gray Paper functions as a critical bridge. Released a decade after his Ethereum Yellow Paper, Gavin Wood’s Gray Paper brings a new vision and a direction. This linguistic bridge connects China’s brilliant young talents with the world’s most advanced tools, enabling them to transcend language barriers and engage in cutting-edge open-source innovation using state-of-the-art global resources.

This comprehensive document, spanning 112 pages, provides an in-depth and formal definition of JAM—a protocol that integrates elements from both Polkadot and Ethereum to establish a robust, scalable, and permissionless smart-contract environment.

JAM introduces a decentralized hybrid system that combines smart-contract functionality with Polkadot’s architecture. It offers a unique in-core/on-chain dualism that ensures both security and scalability. The protocol allows anyone to deploy code as a service, utilizing core-time as a computational resource, much like Ethereum’s gas model.

With this translation, we hope to reach a wider audience, enabling developers, researchers, and blockchain enthusiasts in the Chinese-speaking world to explore and contribute to the evolution of JAM. We look forward to discussions, feedback, and new ideas that can further enhance the potential of this technology.
